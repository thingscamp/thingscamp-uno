## Roomsense
Simple sensor circuit for monitoring the conditions in a room\
This circuit takes measurements several times per second to show temperature, humidity and light levels. 
When you run the sketch that accompanies the circuit, open the Arduino Serial Monitor on-screen to see the values.

### Components
 - Arduino Uno & power cable (connect to your computer)
 - DHT-11 sensor (we used the one from our sensors kit, mounted on a backboard with the pull-down resistor on board)
 - light-dependent resistor
 - connector wires
